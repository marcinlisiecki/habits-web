        Two day rule
      </h2>
      <p class="mt-3 leading-relaxed text-sm md:text-base">
        The 'two-day rule' suggests that you aim not to miss more than one day
        in a row. This approach prevents discouragement after missing a single
        day and makes it easier to get back on track. In our application, your
        streak remains intact if you miss just one day; you won't lose it for
        occasional breaks.

        Back-up goal

      <p class="mt-3 leading-relaxed text-sm md:text-base">
        If you find it challenging to complete the full task, consider
        accomplishing a backup goal that is notably easier and quicker. This
        approach prevents breaking the habit, allowing you to continue the next
        day when you'll have more energy and find it much easier!
